<h1>Organizational Unit </h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
<n>In this lab, we will create an Organizational Unit</n>

The efficient management of Windows Active Directory starts with the creation of Organizational Units (OUs). For the uninitiated, an OU is a container within Active Directory that holds domain objectsâ€”primarily users and groups, but also computers and even other OUs. By using OUs, organizations can apply group policies. More importantly, from my perspective as an IT trainer and consultant, using OUs allows an organization to delegate administrative authority within the domain. This delegation is crucial for letting help desk staff and local system administrators do their jobs without letting them into the whole domain.
